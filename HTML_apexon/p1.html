            <strong>Albert Einstein</strong> (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist
            best known for developing the theory of relativity. He also made important contributions to quantum theory.
        </p>

        <p>
            His mass–energy equivalence formula <em>E = mc²</em> is one of the most famous equations in physics.
            He received the <strong>1921 Nobel Prize in Physics</strong> for his discovery of the photoelectric effect.
        </p>

        <p>
            Born in the German Empire, Einstein later moved to Switzerland and eventually to the United States,
            where he became an American citizen in 1940.
